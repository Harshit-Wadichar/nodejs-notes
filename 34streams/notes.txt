**Streams in Node.js:**  
Streams are like pipelines that let you handle data piece by piece, instead of all at once. Imagine filling a bathtub with a bucket (loading the whole file into memory) vs. using a hose (streams). Streams are better for large data because they use less memory and are faster. There are four types:

1. **Readable Streams**: For reading data (e.g., reading a file).  
2. **Writable Streams**: For writing data (e.g., saving to a file).  
3. **Duplex Streams**: Can read *and* write (e.g., a network socket).  
4. **Transform Streams**: Modify data while passing it (e.g., compressing data).

**Example:**  
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
// Read a file in chunks and write to a new file
fs.createReadStream('bigfile.txt')
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('copy.txt'));
```

**zlib Module in Node.js:**  
The `zlib` module compresses or decompresses data (like turning a big file into a smaller `.zip` file). It uses algorithms like `gzip` or `deflate` to shrink data, making it faster to send over the internet or save disk space.

**How it works with streams:**  
You can pipe data through `zlib` to compress/decompress on the fly:  
```javascript
const zlib = require('zlib');
const fs = require('fs');

// Compress a file using streams
fs.createReadStream('file.txt')
  .pipe(zlib.createGzip()) // Compress the data chunk by chunk
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('file.txt.gz'));
```

**Key Functions:**  
- `zlib.createGzip()`: Compress data.  
- `zlib.createGunzip()`: Decompress data.  
- Similar methods for `deflate`/`inflate` algorithms.

**Why use zlib?**  
- Save storage space.  
- Faster data transfer over networks.  
- Works seamlessly with streams (no memory overload!).  

**Simple analogy:**  
Think of `zlib` as a magic straw that sucks in data, shrinks it, and sends it out‚Äîall while it‚Äôs still flowing through the hose (stream). üéà‚û°Ô∏èüì¶
