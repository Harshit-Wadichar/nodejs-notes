The **Cluster Module** in Node.js allows you to create multiple instances of your application (called "worker processes") to utilize all CPU cores on your machine. Since Node.js runs on a single thread by default, the cluster module helps improve performance and handle more traffic by distributing the workload across multiple cores.

---

### **Explanation of the Code**

#### **1. Import Modules**
```javascript
const cluster = require('node:cluster');
const os = require('os');
const express = require('express');
```
- `cluster`: Used to create worker processes.
- `os`: Provides info about the operating system (like CPU cores).
- `express`: A web framework to create a server.

---

#### **2. Get Total CPU Cores**
```javascript
const totalCpus = os.cpus().length;
```
- `os.cpus().length` returns the number of CPU cores on your machine (e.g., 4 cores, 8 cores).

---

#### **3. Check if the Process is the Primary Process**
```javascript
if (cluster.isPrimary) {
  // Primary process code
} else {
  // Worker process code
}
```
- The **primary process** is the main process. It acts as a manager and creates worker processes.
- The **worker processes** are the child processes that run your actual server code.

---

#### **4. Primary Process: Create Workers**
```javascript
if (cluster.isPrimary) {
  for (let i = 0; i < totalCpus; i++) {
    cluster.fork(); // Create a worker for each CPU core
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```
- The primary process loops over each CPU core and creates a worker using `cluster.fork()`.
- Example: If you have 4 CPU cores, it creates 4 workers.
- `console.log(i)` logs the loop index (0, 1, 2, 3 for 4 cores).

---

#### **5. Worker Process: Start Express Server**
```javascript
else {
  const app = express();
  const PORT = 8000;

  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    return res.json({
      message: `Hello from express Server! ${process.pid}`
    });
  });

  app.listen(PORT, () => { 
    console.log("server started"); 
  });  
}
```
- Each worker process runs this code.
- An Express server is created and listens on port `8000`.
- When you visit `http://localhost:8000`, it sends a response with a message containing the **worker's process ID** (`process.pid`).
- Since each worker has a unique ID, you’ll see different IDs in responses, proving different workers handle requests.

---

### **How It Works**
1. **Primary Process**: 
   - Creates one worker for each CPU core.
   - Example: 4 cores → 4 workers.
   - The primary process **does not run your server code**; it only manages workers.

2. **Worker Processes**:
   - Each worker runs the Express server on the same port (`8000`).
   - The OS handles distributing incoming requests to workers (load balancing).

---

### **Key Benefits**
1. **Performance**: Uses all CPU cores (instead of just one).
2. **Scalability**: Handles more simultaneous requests.
3. **Fault Tolerance**: If one worker crashes, others keep running.

---

### **Example Output**
If you open `http://localhost:8000` in multiple tabs, you’ll see responses like:
```json
{ "message": "Hello from express Server! 1234" }
{ "message": "Hello from express Server! 5678" }
```
Different `process.pid` values indicate different workers handled the requests.
