### Corrected Explanation of HTTP Methods:
1. **GET**:  
   - **What it does:** This method is used to request or retrieve data from the server. For example, when you type a URL in your browser, it sends a `GET` request to fetch the web page.  
   - **Clarification:** By default, web browsers typically use `GET` requests for loading pages, but web browsers can perform other methods too (like `POST` through forms).

---

2. **POST**:  
   - **What it does:** This method is used to send data to the server. It's commonly used for operations like submitting forms or uploading files.  
   - **Clarification:** It is not limited to mutating data. While it's often used to create or modify resources, the exact operation depends on how the server handles the request.

---

3. **PUT**:  
   - **What it does:** This method is used to completely replace or create a resource on the server. For instance, updating a user profile might use a `PUT` request to overwrite the existing data with the new one.  
   - **Clarification:** It does not directly "add to the database." Instead, it updates or replaces data entirely.

---

4. **PATCH**:  
   - **What it does:** This method is used to partially update a resource on the server. For example, if only one field in a database needs to be updated (e.g., changing just the email address for a user profile), `PATCH` is often used.  
   - **Clarification:** This is for partial modifications, not wholesale changes like `PUT`.

---

5. **DELETE**:  
   - **What it does:** This method is used to remove a resource from the server, typically from a database.  
   - **Clarification:** Your definition is correct here!
