In Node.js, the `fs` (File System) module allows you to interact with the file system. The primary difference between synchronous (sync) and asynchronous (non-sync) functions in the `fs` module lies in how they handle execution and blocking:

### Synchronous (`fs.*Sync` methods):
1. **Blocking Execution**: Synchronous methods block the execution of code. This means no other code can run until the current file operation is completed.
2. **Usage**: These methods are simpler to write but can significantly impact performance, especially in applications that require high concurrency.
   - Example: `fs.readFileSync()`, `fs.writeFileSync()`

   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');
   const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8'); // Code execution is paused here.
   console.log(data);
   ```

3. **Use Cases**: Best suited for scripts or small utilities where performance and concurrency are not critical.

### Asynchronous (Non-sync) functions:
1. **Non-blocking Execution**: Asynchronous methods do not block the event loop. Instead, they take a callback (or return a `Promise`) and allow other code to execute while the file operation is being processed.
2. **Usage**: These methods are more complex but enable better performance in concurrent applications.
   - Example with Callback: `fs.readFile()`
   - Example with Promises: `fs.promises.readFile()`

   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');
   // Using callback
   fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log(data); // This runs after the file is read.
   });

   // Using Promises
   const fsPromises = require('fs').promises;
   fsPromises.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8')
       .then(data => console.log(data))
       .catch(err => console.error(err));
   ```

3. **Use Cases**: Essential for server-side applications where multiple users or tasks need to be handled simultaneously.

### Summary of Key Differences:

| Feature              | Synchronous (`Sync`)             | Asynchronous (`Non-sync`)       |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Execution**        | Blocking                         | Non-blocking                    |
| **Concurrency**      | Poor                             | Excellent                       |
| **Complexity**       | Easier to write                  | More complex (callbacks/Promises) |
| **Use Case**         | Small utilities, quick scripts   | High-performance applications   |
