In HTTP, headers are pieces of information that are sent along with a request or response. Think of them as labels or tags that provide extra details about the communication between the client (like a browser) and the server. For example, headers can specify the type of content being sent, the language, or authentication details.

In Node.js, you can access and set HTTP headers using the `http` module or frameworks like Express.

Here’s a simple example to show how headers work in Node.js:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

// Create a server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Access headers from the client
  console.log('Request Headers:', req.headers);

  // Set a response header
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  
  // Send a response
  res.end('Hello! This is a response with headers.');
});

// Start the server
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

### Explanation:
1. **Accessing Headers**:
   - `req.headers`: This retrieves the headers sent by the client. For example, it might include details about the browser (`User-Agent`) or accepted languages (`Accept-Language`).

2. **Setting Headers**:
   - `res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')`: This sets a response header to indicate the type of content being sent (in this case, plain text).

3. **Sending a Response**:
   - After setting the header, we send a response using `res.end()`.

When you run this code and visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, the server will send a plain text response, and you’ll see the client’s request headers printed in the terminal.

Headers are super useful in HTTP communication, as they control how data is exchanged! Let me know if you'd like a deeper dive into this!
