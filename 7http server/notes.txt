Absolutely, Ankit! Let me explain each term in simple words:

### **1. HTTP Module**
- In Node.js, the **HTTP module** is a built-in feature that helps us create servers and handle requests (like a browser asking for a webpage) and responses (like sending back the webpage).
- Think of it as the toolkit that makes it easy to send and receive data over the internet.

### **2. Port Number**
- A **port number** is like a "door" on your computer that allows programs to communicate. Every server needs a port to "listen" for incoming requests.
- For example, web browsers usually use port `80` for websites. In Node.js, we can choose a specific port (like 3000) for our server to listen for connections.

### **3. `createServer` Function**
- The `createServer` function (from the HTTP module) is used to create a server in Node.js. This server listens for requests and decides how to respond.
- Imagine youâ€™re running a shop. When customers (requests) arrive, you need a server (shopkeeper) to respond (like serving them products or information).

Hereâ€™s how it works:
```javascript
const http = require('http'); // Importing the HTTP module

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.write('Hello, world!'); // Writing a response
  res.end(); // Ending the response
});
```
In this example, a basic server is created that sends "Hello, world!" whenever it receives a request.

### **4. `listen` Function**
- The `listen` function tells the server to start listening on a specific port. Itâ€™s like saying, "Hey server, start waiting for requests on door number (port) 3000."
  
Example:
```javascript
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```
This tells the server to listen on port `3000` and shows a message when itâ€™s ready.

### **Simple Summary**
- **HTTP Module:** The toolbox for creating servers and handling web communication.
- **Port Number:** The door your server listens on for requests.
- **`createServer`:** Creates a server to handle requests and send responses.
- **`listen`:** Starts the server and tells it which port to use.

Think of it like running a restaurant:
- The **HTTP module** gives you the tools to cook and serve food.
- The **port number** is the door where customers enter.
- The **server** (via `createServer`) is the chef who prepares the food.
- The **listen function** ensures the restaurant is open and ready to serve customers at the right door.
